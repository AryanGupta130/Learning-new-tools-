# Stock Market Analyzer 

This project will be able to read different quantitative data regarding 
the stock market. Some aspects will be calculated will be:      
1) Ability to see top x stocks with the largest growth in the last (hour, 24 hours, week, month, and year)
2) Liquidity Assesment:  Volume indicates the level of liquidity in a stock or market. Higher volume generally means higher liquidity, making it easier to buy or sell shares without significantly affecting the price. Lower volume may result in wider bid-ask spreads and increased price volatility.
3) Price Data:
    1) Open Price: The price of a stock at the beginning of a trading session.
    2) Close Price: The price of a stock at the end of a trading session.
    3) High Price: The highest price of a stock during a trading session.
    4) Low Price: The lowest price of a stock during a trading session.
    5) Adjusted Close Price: The closing price of a stock adjusted for factors such as dividends, stock splits, and corporate actions.
    
4) As this project grows, I can include more important information. I hope to expand upon this with information regarding options trading and options strategies
