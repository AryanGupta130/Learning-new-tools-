Updates as I go on the project:

What has been done soo far: 
1) I have created the ability to pull in stock information for any stock
2) I have created the ability to create a graph of the stock over a trend of time
3) I have pulled in the stock for the current date and have put that into a graph. 

Goals for today:
1) I want to be able to intergrate the data from today with the data that I have overall
2) Lets see if their is an API to get the graphs of the stocks itself, I don't know if possible
